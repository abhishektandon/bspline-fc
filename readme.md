> We propose a trait-specific image generation method that models forehead creases geometrically using B-spline and BÃ©zier curves. This approach ensures the realistic generation of both principal creases and non-prominent crease patterns effectively constructing detailed and authentic forehead-crease images. These geometrically rendered images serve as visual prompts for a diffusion-based Edge-to-Image translation model which generates corresponding mated samples. The resulting novel synthetic identities are then used to train a forehead-crease verification network. To enhance intra-subject diversity in the generated samples we employ two strategies: (a) perturbing the control points of B-splines under defined constraints to maintain label consistency and (b) applying image-level augmentations to the geometric visual prompts such as dropout and elastic transformations specifically tailored to crease patterns. By integrating the proposed synthetic dataset with real-world data our method significantly improves the performance of forehead-crease verification systems under a cross-database verification protocol.


## Render Creases

Render Raw Samples (1 Image per ID):
```
python render.py
```
Add Visual Prompt Diversity (VPD) to raw samples:

```
python augs.py
```

## Edge2FC Generative Model

Extract Edge Maps:

```
python ./utils/extract_edges.py
```

Training/Sampling: 
```
./edge2fc/shell/scripts.sh
```
